![Contract Testing With Dapp](2024-04-10.jpeg)

Did some contract testing today with a quick boilerplate Dapp. Put together a simple UI using Material UI and developing
with React. Functionality is robust and we officially have posted the first post on Solswipe! (on devnet lol 😛). Will
continue adding some more of our contract features to this boilerplate as we anticipate our launch. UI team is hard at
work finalizing the remaining pieces of the actual Dapp design which we will integrate into our boilerplate.
